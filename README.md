# wRebeca

wRebca is a tool for modeling and verification of protocols in a static or dynamic network. We refere to a network with more than one possible topology as the dynaimc network. For example, mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs) have dynamic network since their topology is constantly changing. 

wRebeca tool provide some reduction techniques to overcome state space explosion which is a well-known problem in model checking approaches.
